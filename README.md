# mathpad
Simple editor with inline math.

Demo: https://raw.githack.com/mzechmeister/mathpad/main/index.html

Uses [MathQuill](http://mathquill.com) in a `contenteditable` html element.

The editor aims for a fast drafting of math ideas and derivations having many tedious equation. The resulting text snippets with latex code can be copied back to a more elaborated pad or markdown editors, which usually only provides latex math or pop-up math widgets.
`mathpad` is only a proof of concept.
